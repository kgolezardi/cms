"""Constraints adding server-side validation to a SQLAlchemy Column.

This module provides classes that can be used to add constraints to
textual Columns in order to ensure that the values in these columns
always match a given regular expression (unless they are NULL). These
conditions are enforced server-side, by the database itself, and are
added to the table upon creation. Only PostgreSQL and psycopg2 are
supported.
